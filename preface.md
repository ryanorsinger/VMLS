# Purpose
- Provide an introduction to vectors, matrices, and least squares methods.
- Provide a good grounding and appreciation for vectors, matrices, and least squares methods with data fitting, ML, tomography, navigation, image processing, finance, and automatic control systems

## Focus
- We use 1 theoretical concept: linear independence
- We use 1 computational tool: QR factorization
- We use 1 method: least squares (or some extension)
